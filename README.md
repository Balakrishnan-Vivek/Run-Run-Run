<h1>Run Run Run</h1>
<p>Run Run Run is a open web app for FirefoxOS. This project is developped for #Comete Project</p>

<p>The application can be used by different people. Each person creates a profile where it can inquire various information such as its weight and size. Each profile is identified by a nickname/name.</p>

<p>The application saves the path of the user via the phone's GPS position and displays it on a map. It also calculates distance, altitude, and duration of the course, the user's speed, and calories burned.
The application displays the position of the user on a map in real time.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each course, the user has to select the mode. Several methods are available, such as biking, running, or hiking. Each mode has its specificities to calculate calories burned.</p>

<p>This app was test on Firefox, Firefox for Android, FirefoxOS Simulator with Firefox module. I can't test it with B2G Client Desktop (due to issues during the installation) and devphone (I haven't).</p>
<p>Several settings are available for example, the interval between geolocations user. This setting will save the phone battery.</p>

<p> RunRunRun began for school project called "Recherche & Developpement", we were three in our dev team :
<ul>
<li>Marine</li>
<li>Aymeric</li>
<li>Simon</li>
</ul>
Marine & Aymeric start an other project and I want to add ameliorations to RunRunRun</p>

<p>After "Recherche & Developpement" , RunRunRun working fonctionnalites are :
<ul>
<li>Tags management : add, edit, delete</li>
<li>Profils management : add, edit, delete</li>
<li>Start, pause and stop a course </li>
<li>Display list of courses </li>
<li>Diplay details of a course (distance, duration, Google Maps)</li>
</ul>
</p>

Now : the todo list for this part of RunRunRun (Projet "DÃ©veloppement de Logiciels Libres") is the following :
<ul>
<li>To test the app in FirefoxOS simulator or on FirefoxOS device</li>
<li>To ameliore the first launch of the app</li>
<li>To configure which profile to use for the current course</li>
<li>To test optimization of the geolocation algorithm</li>
<li>To add a marker/notification showing if GPS is ready</li>
<li>To translate in English (Internationalization)</li>
<li>To add filters (use tags, profiles, sports) on the page displaying list of courses</li>
<li>To do the app working with OpenStreetMap, Nokia Map, Bing Maps</li>
<li>To add the possibility to choice the Maps API (Google maps, OpenStreetMap)</li>
<li>To delete course</li>
<li>Go back home function</li>
</ul>
